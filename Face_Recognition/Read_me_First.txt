This is a simple implementation of haar-cascades to recognise human face and eyes in Open-CV.
It is a real time face recognition system.Here I have just used frontalface and eye haar-cascades,
you can add different haar-cascades to detect other parts and change the code accordingly.  


REQUIREMENTS:-
